- `info_board`: A list representing the board with position numbers for reference.
- `currentPlayer`: A variable to keep track of the current player ('X' or 'O').
- `gameOn`: A boolean variable to control the game loop.

### Functions

- `welcome(info_board)`: Displays the welcome message and instructions.

### Main Game Loop

The main game loop continuously checks for a full board and a winner, takes player input, switches the player, and prints the updated board until the game is over.

```python
welcome(info_board)
while gameOn:
    board_full(board)
    checkWinner()
    if gameOn:
        takePlayerinput(board)
    switchPlayer()
    printBoard(board)
